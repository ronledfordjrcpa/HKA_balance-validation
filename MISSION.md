# Value Statement

"Our priority is to successfully migrate financial operations from Dynamics GP to Sage Intacct, establishing Sage Intacct as the financial reporting backbone for HKA. The primary focus of this implementation is to leverage Sage Intacct’s robust financial reporting capabilities to provide leadership with timely, accurate, and actionable insights into the company’s performance. TempWorks (ATS) serves as the transactional backbone of HKA’s operations, managing critical details for payroll, staffing, and other client and employee transactions. Sage Intacct will integrate seamlessly with TempWorks to ensure that detailed transactional data—such as client billings, employee payments, and operational metrics—flows accurately into the financial reporting system. While accounts payable processes are supported within Sage Intacct, the primary objective is to create a centralized reporting framework that aligns operational data with financial results. By prioritizing accurate reporting and integration, HKA will enhance decision-making, ensure compliance, improve transparency for both clients and employees, and establish a scalable foundation for future growth."
