# Alternatives to Onsite Involvement for HKA Dynamics GP to Sage Intacct Migration

## Context
Given the commitments that prevent extended onsite work and Raji's preference for onsite involvement, here are some proposed alternatives to contribute effectively to the project while balancing logistical constraints.

---

## Proposed Alternatives

### 1. Hybrid Arrangement
- **Proposal**: Offer a schedule that includes periodic onsite visits (e.g., 1-2 weeks per month) with the remaining time remote.
- **Benefits**:
  - Focus onsite time on critical tasks such as trial balance validation, staff training, and collaboration with the team.
  - Manage other tasks remotely to ensure consistent progress.

---

### 2. Collaborative Leadership Role
- **Proposal**: Act as a remote consultant leading a local point of contact onsite.
- **Benefits**:
  - Provide guidance and define validation steps while delegating day-to-day activities to an onsite team member.
  - Maintain oversight and ensure project alignment through virtual check-ins.

---

### 3. Limited Engagement for Specific Deliverables
- **Proposal**: Focus on solving key bottlenecks (e.g., trial balance validation, data mapping) during a defined short-term engagement.
- **Benefits**:
  - Deliver immediate value by addressing the most pressing issues.
  - Provide a solid foundation for the team to continue the implementation.

---

### 4. Alternative Resources with Remote Support
- **Proposal**: Assist in identifying or onboarding a local resource for onsite work while supporting remotely as a senior consultant.
- **Benefits**:
  - Leverage your expertise for strategic oversight without the need for extended onsite presence.
  - Ensure knowledge transfer and continuity.

---

### 5. Short-Term Relocation (If Feasible)
- **Proposal**: Consider a temporary relocation with clearly defined project timelines (e.g., 4-6 weeks).
- **Benefits**:
  - Provide the required onsite support for the most critical project phase.
  - Align expectations with a definitive timeline for completion.

---

## Next Steps
1. **Clarify Project Scope**:
   - Confirm key deliverables and immediate priorities.
   - Focus on addressing Rajiâ€™s pain points, such as trial balance validation and leadership needs.

2. **Communicate Boundaries**:
   - Clearly outline your availability and limitations.
   - Emphasize your ability to deliver results effectively, even with reduced onsite presence.

3. **Negotiate a Win-Win Solution**:
   - Propose alternatives while demonstrating your commitment to the projectâ€™s success.

## Conclusion
By considering these alternatives, we can address the project's needs while respecting logistical constraints. Open communication will help determine the best path forward for both HKA and my role in the migration project.

# Subject: Follow-Up on Sage Intacct Migration Role

Dear Matt and Raji,

Thank you both for taking the time to speak with me about the Sage Intacct migration project. I truly appreciated the insights shared, particularly regarding the challenges surrounding the validation of trial balances and the General Ledger setup.

I understand your concerns about the need for onsite involvement. After reflecting on our discussion, I must acknowledge that an extended onsite commitment is not feasible for me due to logistical limitations and my personal commitments in Nashville.

That said, I have considered several alternative approaches that may help address the projectâ€™s needs without requiring a full-time onsite presence:
- **Hybrid Approach**: Periodic onsite visits (e.g., one week per month) combined with remote work for consistent progress.
- **Remote Leadership**: Acting as a senior consultant remotely, guiding a local point of contact for daily execution.
- **Short-Term Engagement**: Delivering targeted solutions to address key bottlenecks, such as trial balance validation or integration issues.

I would be happy to discuss these options further and explore how we can best move forward to ensure the success of the project.

Please let me know a convenient time to connect.

Best regards,  
**Ron Ledford, CPA, MBA**
