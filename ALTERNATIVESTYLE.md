# Subject: Follow-Up on Sage Intacct Migration Role

Dear Matt and Raji,

Thank you both for taking the time to speak with me about the Sage Intacct migration project. I truly appreciated the insights shared, particularly regarding the challenges surrounding the validation of trial balances and the General Ledger setup.

I understand your concerns about the need for onsite involvement. After reflecting on our discussion, I must acknowledge that an extended onsite commitment is not feasible for me due to logistical limitations and my personal commitments in Nashville.

That said, I have considered several alternative approaches that may help address the projectâ€™s needs without requiring a full-time onsite presence:
- **Hybrid Approach**: Periodic onsite visits (e.g., one week per month) combined with remote work for consistent progress.
- **Remote Leadership**: Acting as a senior consultant remotely, guiding a local point of contact for daily execution.
- **Short-Term Engagement**: Delivering targeted solutions to address key bottlenecks, such as trial balance validation or integration issues.

I would be happy to discuss these options further and explore how we can best move forward to ensure the success of the project.

Please let me know a convenient time to connect.

Best regards,  
**Ron Ledford, CPA, MBA**
